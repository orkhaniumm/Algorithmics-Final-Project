# Algorithmics-Final-Project

## Description 
The project is committed to conducting an in-depth comparative 
analysis of the selected (top) prime number generation methods. Prime examples 
include Sieves of Atkin, Sundaram, Eratosthenes and probabilistic tests like Miller
Rabin. By analyzing the specified (and possibly even more) algorithms from 
several noteworthy aspects, we aim to have a thorough assessment of the 
algorithms.

## Motivation and Challenge
In fact, prime number generation is taking a 
significant place in the fundamentals of Computer Science, especially with 
Cryptography and Numerical Analysis methodologies. For instance, RSA keys are 
formulated by multiplying two big prime numbers, and finding those numbers is 
one of the base challenges in Cryptography, for which no better algorithm rather 
than Shor (needs quantum computers) has been proposed so far (for big integers). 
Hence, it is significant to analyze the prime number generation methods and 
evaluate them per few top criteria.
